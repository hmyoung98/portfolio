   <div class='section content'>
	   <p>I prioritize finding balance between the often juxtaposed right and left-brain skills. In my senior year of high school my art teacher offered me a spot in his AP Studio Art class despite having less technical training compared to my classmates. I succeeded personally and academically through proper time management and honing of various techniques. Substantial time was placed in planning, photographing, and editing compositions. This time allowed me to become familiar with Photoshop, to develop an understanding of layout, and to implement color and contrast in my design. My academic path is directed towards a creative career that will allow me to strengthen these skills and develop new ones.</p>
